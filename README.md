# RM-CV-Part

 Codes of computer vision part for Internal Robot Master Competition of SCUT. 
 
 (华工机器人对抗赛校内赛正赛中CV部分的代码)
 
### Versions of language and modules
Python: 3.9

Opencv: 4.5.2

numpy: 1.19.2

### Project structure
shape_detect.py

### Creative Points
1. Use Laplacian Pyramids to reduce the influence of moire pattern. And catch the edges by cv.Canny().
2. Use two different morphological operations with different kernel which is the best size debugged via trackbar.
3. Use the way "S / l"(the value of area size devided by length) to removing noise generated by the dust and high light reflection on the screen.
4. "cv.Canny()" sometimes may detect one edge into two edges, outer and inner. So use the distance between two neighbour edges to filter them.
5. Use voting method to detect the shape. "Circles" and "None" shapes are given 1/3 vote while others are given 1 vote.

### End
A "test.pptx" file, a "update log.md" file and some ".png" files as results of detection are attached.
